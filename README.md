# Object-Recognition-using-ResNet50
This project involves training a deep learning model for multi-class image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, utilizing both a basic neural network and a fine-tuned ResNet50 pre-trained model. Initially, the CIFAR-10 dataset, comprising 50,000 training and 10,000 test images across 10 classes, was downloaded and processed. The dataset was converted into NumPy arrays, scaled to normalize pixel values, and split into training and test sets. A simple neural network was constructed with input flattening, dense layers, and the ReLU activation function, followed by a softmax output layer for class probabilities. This model was compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, achieving reasonable performance.
For improved accuracy, the ResNet50 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, was fine-tuned. The convolutional base of ResNet50 extracted high-level features, while additional custom layers (including fully connected layers, dropout, and batch normalization) were added for classification. Images were upsampled to match ResNet50â€™s input dimensions. The model was compiled with the RMSprop optimizer and trained over 10 epochs, achieving a high test accuracy of 93.86%. Finally, training and validation loss and accuracy trends were plotted to evaluate model performance and generalization.
This project demonstrates a robust workflow for leveraging pre-trained models and building scalable pipelines for image classification tasks
